However, Wozniak did not disclose the amount of BTC he purchased. He cited that he did not want to be the kind of person that regularly watches numbers as the reason for liquidating his entire BTC investment.</p>

   <p style="background-image:none;">As the crypto bear market has many mining operations shutting down, the more determined outfits continue to search for cost-cutting moves to maintain operation. Reports are indicating that one of those options is Iran, which has extremely low electricity costs, sometimes as low as $0.006 per kilowatt-hour, which is starting to attract the attention of numerous Chinese mining operations. There are no firms in Iran which produce crypto miners, and with cheap secondhand miners available in China, going through the difficult process of getting set up in Iran remains a good business decision.</p>

   <p style="background-image:none;">我不认为“加密社区中的许多人开始认为（权益证明PoS）这个概念是错的”这个说法是准确的。那些相信 PoS 的人 将保持信仰始终如一。而那些了解工作量证明（PoW）和了解为什么永动机无法实现的人总称 PoS 是荒谬的。</p>
   <p style="background-image:none;">I don't think it's accurate to say "many within the crypto community are beginning to reject the concept (PoS) as faulty."

   <p style="background-image:none;">Ethereum as a fundraising platform is unstoppable. It’s too flexible and easy, so the market will just adapt.</p>
   <p style="background-image:none;">Initial security offerings greatly interest me. People will get actual ownership and rights to revenue in companies. Unlike 2017 ICOs which represent mostly nothing.</p>
