{"description":"arping的-b参数用于发送以太网广播帧（FFFFFFFFFFFF）。arping一开始使用广播地址，在收到响应后就使用unicast地址，但下面的试验实际上192.168.129.76已经是k2-a的IP，所以在k2-a上发送arping广播包向网络询问谁用了192.168.129.76这个IP，实际上k2-a会一直得不到回应的，所以k2-a将一直发送该广播包，利用跟这个机制，可以用arping一直发送广播包，这样就可以check同网段的其他host是否收到了广播包，从而check网络是不是通的，重要的是比较同网段的不同host接收次广播包时是否有差异，例如某些host收到了广播包，但没有触发网卡中断，而另外的host是正常触发的。 在k2-a上发广播包（会一直得不到响应）： root@k2-a:~# arping -I eth1 192.168.129.76 -b &amp;
