<meta name="description" content=",关于今天要分享的这个博客，最大的感触就是美国的消费方式跟我们的有挺大的区别。在我们这边，在网络上消费之后，我们会再三确认交易金额之后，再输入密码确认交易，以避免产生不必要的开销。而目前我所能接触到的美国的消费方式，比如优步还有后面要说到的亚马逊云服务器的消费，都是先绑定信用卡之后，产生的费用会由服务公司直接划款而不需要用户再三确认并输入密码来确认交易。可见美国的消费者在消费上给予了服务商足够的信任，而我们看起来则是略显没有安全感。 据我在百度上搜索了解到的信息，应该有很多人看到亚马逊云服务器免费使用1年这个信息，然后一个箭步跑到亚马逊服务器官网上去注册申请服务器，结果发现全是英文，然后就在一知半解的情况下啪啪啪一通乱点，结果发现被扣费了（没错就是说我自己( ▼-▼ )）。 后面发现在网站控制台里翻了个遍都没找到取消服务或者申请退费的功能。百度了下也没找到相关信息，只是看到有人建议创建工单(Case)来处理。所以我就跑到控制台创建了一个工单，后面会附上我整个工单的对话内容。 一开始创建了工单他们24小时都没有给回复，后面我又提交了电话工单，接通了电话跟他们一通乱扯(只有英文服务，也不知道他们听懂没)，他们才答应在5分钟内回复我。第一次回复只给了取消收费功能的方法，在我第二次回复要求退款之后他们才答应全款退回，共40.6美金，300大洋1年多的阿里云服务器啊。。 取消收费功能： 1. 打开页面: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account (这个页面最下面可以关闭服务，不会再被收取任何费用，大家不要马上点击最下面的关闭服务，否则还是会被持续扣钱的，必须先取消服务) 2. 点击“Cancel Services,” 下面的“Click Here”. 3. 点击“Change Plan”. 4. 选择“Basic Support” 然后点击“Change Plan”. 下面附上我的工单对话内容,英语水平比较低，大家将就看( ▼-▼ )。 Amazon Web Services Dec 5, 2016 10:14 PM +0800 Hello Harry, Thank you for your response and once again please accept my apologies for the Support charges. As I can see that you’ve changed to the free Basic Support plan, I’ve requested a refund of all of the charges on your account in the amount of $40.60.

Amazon Web Services Dec 5, 2016 08:23 PM +0800 Hello Harry, I’m sorry for any concern caused by the charges on your account. At this time we only offer support in English but I’d like to explain why you were charged. I’ve checked your account and I see that you signed up for one of our paid Premium Support plans which do not form part of the Free Tier offer and this is why you were charged. To stop more charges on your account, you can cancel your Premium Support subscription by following these steps: 1. Visit the Account Settings page: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account 2. Under “Cancel Services,” select “Click Here”. 3. Click “Change Plan”. 4. Choose “Basic Support” and click “Change Plan”. You will be automatically issued a pro-rated refund for the remainder of the month’s Premium Support charges. Please be aware that if you have been signed up for AWS Technical Support for less than one month, you may be subject to a minimum fee. For details, please see our FAQ’s here: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#pro-rating Alternatively, you can also close your AWS account as this will automatically stop all charges. Our security policy prevents us from closing your account on your behalf, but you can close your AWS account yourself by clicking the link below, scrolling to the bottom of the page, and clicking on the Close Account checkbox and button. https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account Once you close your Amazon Web Services account, you will no longer be able to access the AWS Management Console, any resources on your account will be terminated, and any Access Keys you have will be deactivated. You will not lose access to the Billing and Cost Management Console, so you’ll still be able to view information about your account’s past billing and activity. Note that if you have been using any opt-in services this month, you may still receive a charge. This will have no effect on any Amazon.com accounts that share the same email address as this AWS account.

   <p>harry <br> Dec 4, 2016 <br> 02:15 PM +0800 <br> I just saw your AD last month and it said your could server is free for a year. So i registered and follow your introduction to use the free server, but when i found it take pre-authorization from my credit card i interrupted and didn’t use it any more.And NOW i found it COST my money. I don’t know why ,please just refund and cancel my servise. TKS for your time！</p>
