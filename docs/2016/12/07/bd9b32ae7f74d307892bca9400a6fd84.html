Amazon Web Services Dec 5, 2016 08:23 PM +0800 Hello Harry, I’m sorry for any concern caused by the charges on your account. At this time we only offer support in English but I’d like to explain why you were charged. I’ve checked your account and I see that you signed up for one of our paid Premium Support plans which do not form part of the Free Tier offer and this is why you were charged. To stop more charges on your account, you can cancel your Premium Support subscription by following these steps: 1. Visit the Account Settings page: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account 2. Under “Cancel Services,” select “Click Here”. 3. Click “Change Plan”. 4. Choose “Basic Support” and click “Change Plan”. You will be automatically issued a pro-rated refund for the remainder of the month’s Premium Support charges.

Our security policy prevents us from closing your account on your behalf, but you can close your AWS account yourself by clicking the link below, scrolling to the bottom of the page, and clicking on the Close Account checkbox and button. https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account Once you close your Amazon Web Services account, you will no longer be able to access the AWS Management Console, any resources on your account will be terminated, and any Access Keys you have will be deactivated. You will not lose access to the Billing and Cost Management Console, so you’ll still be able to view information about your account’s past billing and activity.
