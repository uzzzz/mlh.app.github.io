  <p>All is well thatends well. Or is it?</p> 
  <p>Check the"Grouped" button, open the WITH category, check "WITH_QT".Press configure. Another chunk of errors:</p> 
  <p>CMake Warning atC:/software/CMake 2.8/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindQt4.cmake:615 (message):C:/software/qt/5.0.1/mingw47_32/bin/qmake.exe reported QT_INSTALL_LIBS as"C:/software/qt/5.0.1/mingw47_32/lib" but QtCore could not be foundthere. Qt is NOT installed correctly for the target build environment. CallStack (most recent call first):</p> 
  <p>cmake/OpenCVFindLibsGUI.cmake:8(find_package) CMakeLists.txt:377 (include)</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>So, as one mightsuspect from the error message, the program can't find the libraries. Iremedied this as follows. Expand the categori QT, find the valueQT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_DEBUG, enter</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>"C:/software/qt/5.0.1/mingw47_32/bin/Qt5Cored.dll"and just below it you'll find QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_RELEASE, enter"C:/software/qt/5.0.1/mingw47_32/bin/Qt5Core.dll" NOW, you can pressconfigure (hopefully) witho0ut warnings and after that you can press Generateand everything will be dandy and you can follow the cookbook tutorial.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Now that you have completed theinstallation, you are ready to compile the OpenCV library. Start the Windowscmd console and go to the directory where you installed your builds. Typemingw32-make </p> 
  <p>NOTICE( the OpenCV-2.3.1 is the&nbsp; directory Where &nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;build the binaries in the CMAKE GUI，也就是相当于c:\software\opencvMinGW)</p> 
  <p align="center"></p> 
  <p>Building everything will take time…..</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Once this built completed, you type <code>mingw32-make install</code></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>This last step will install the library and the include files inthe <code>install</code> directory. Note that for clarity, you can rename this directoryas <code>release</code> since you ask CMake to build a Release install.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Before we build our first OpenCV project, we need to add a fewmore folders to the <code>Path</code> environment variable. First,you need to tell your system where to find the OpenCV dlls. From ourinstallation process, they are in <code>C:\OpenCV-2.3.1\install\bin</code>.</p> 
  <p style="background:#C0C4DC;"></p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Btw, these arethe additional path variables I added to System Variables. I dunno, maybe acouple of them are unneccesary but I'm not about to start messing with themwhen everything finally works.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>C:\software\qt\Tools\MinGW\bin;</p> 
  <p>C:\software\Qt\Tools\MinGW;</p> 
  <p>C:\software\opencvMinGW\install\bin;</p> 
  <p>And don't forgetthat you need to change the DLL names to 244 instead of 231, like this:</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>LIBS +=-LC:\\software\\opencvMinGW\\install\\lib \</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -lopencv_core244.dll \</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -lopencv_highgui244.dll \</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -lopencv_imgproc244.dll \</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -lopencv_features2d244.dll \</p> 
  <p>-lopencv_calib3d244.dll</p>
