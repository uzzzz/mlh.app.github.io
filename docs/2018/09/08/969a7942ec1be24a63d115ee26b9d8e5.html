<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># when the server and client are run as the same user.</span>
<span class="hljs-preprocessor">#</span>
<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># If not, you must set rpcuser and rpcpassword to secure the JSON-RPC api. The first</span>

<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># NOTE: opening up the RPC port to hosts outside your local trusted network is NOT RECOMMENDED,</span>

<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># Pay an optional transaction fee every time you send bitcoins. Transactions with fees</span>
