  <h2>让你成功安装vscode中go的相关插件</h2> 
  <p>注意：该演示环境是windows环境，linux和mac环境操作思路一样</p> 
  <p>vscode中有很多go的相关插件，非常好用如下：<br> gocode<br> gopkgs<br> go-outline<br> go-symbols<br> guru<br> gorename<br> gomodifytags<br> goplay<br> impl<br> godef<br> goreturns<br> golint<br> gotests<br> dlv</p> 
  <p>但是由于各种原因，这些插件无法安装，甚至你FQ之后发现也还是无法安装，加上最近FQ被限制的这么严格，所以总结了如下方法，让你在不FQ的情况下还能将这些插件安装成功，下图是我直接通过vscode安装提示的错误：<br><img alt="" class="has" src="http://www.pythonsite.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15120279577729.jpg">￼</p> 
  <p>貌似运气还不错，还安装成功了几个，但是大部分还是没有安装成功，下面是详细的安装日志：</p>

  <p>其实去src目录下看的话，是下载成功了，但是没有安装成功，并且我们也可以看出有几个是可以直接安装成功的<br> github.com/nsf/gocode<br> github.com/tpng/gopkgs<br> github.com/fatih/gomodifytags<br> github.com/haya14busa/goplay<br> github.com/rogpeppe/gode<br> github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv</p> 
  <h2 id="toc_0">解决方法</h2> 
  <p>关于go开发目录的结构这里不做过多解释，之前已经说过了</p> 
  <p>进行如下命令进行目录切换：<br> cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\golang<br> 我这里的GOPATH是在D:\go_project<br> 如果src目录下面没有github.com\golang请自行创建</p> 
  <p>完成目录切换后，开始下载插件包：<br> git clone&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/golang/tools.git" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/golang/tools.git</a>&nbsp;tools</p> 
  <p>当下载完成后，你会发现%GOPATH%\src\github.com\golang多了一个tools目录<br> 需要把tools目录下的所有文件拷贝到%GOPATH%\src\golang.org\x\tools下，如果没有自行创建<br> 当然如果你是windows环境，如果你当前是在%GOPATH%\src\golang.org\x\tools<br> 目录下，你可以直接使用如下命令进行拷贝：<br> xcopy /s /e %GOPATH%\src\github.com\golang\tools<br> 关于这个命令的使用可以具体百度查看，如果对该命令不熟悉就手动拷贝,直接将你下载的tools目录下的所有文件拷贝到%GOPATH%\src\golang.org\x\tools目录下</p> 
  <p>经过多次测试，插件中有几个其实不用FQ或其他方法就可以安装成功：<br> github.com/nsf/gocode<br> github.com/uudashr/gopkgs/cmd/gopkgs<br> github.com/fatih/gomodifytags<br> github.com/haya14busa/goplay/cmd/goplay<br> github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv</p> 
  <p>下面安装无法安装的插件<br> 开始安装：<br> 切换到GOPATH目录下，执行相关的go install 命令</p> 
  <p>go install github.com/ramya-rao-a/go-outline</p> 
  <p>go install github.com/acroca/go-symbols</p> 
  <p>go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru</p> 
  <p>go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gorename</p> 
  <p>go install github.com/josharian/impl</p> 
  <p>go install github.com/rogpeppe/godef</p> 
  <p>go install github.com/sqs/goreturns</p> 
  <p>go install github.com/golang/lint/golint</p> 
  <p>go install github.com/cweill/gotests/gotests</p> 
  <p>这样vscode下go开发需要安装的插件都已经安装成功</p>
