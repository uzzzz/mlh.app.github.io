Bitcoin and crypto lovers all around have seen Ethereum as an interesting platform that promises scalability, reliability and growth potential. If you still haven’t started using (or at least experimenting with) Ethereum, it’s high time you should try your hands on it. The speed with which Ethereum is evolving and grabbing the market share is astonishing. ‘That’s great. But hey, where do I start?’ If that’s what you’re thinking, you’ve landed in the right place. In this guide, we’ll cover everything to help you get started with Ethereum. What is Ethereum? Ethereum By standard definition: Ethereum is a&nbsp;decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. To operate the distributed application platform Ethereum, you need a fuel:&nbsp;Ether. It is a form of payment made by the clients of the platform to the machines executing the requested operations. To put it another way, ether is the incentive ensuring that developers write quality applications (wasteful code costs more), and that the network remains healthy (people are compensated for their contributed resources). That’s pretty much what you need to know at this stage to get started. If you’re still intrigued and want to learn more, go&nbsp;here&nbsp;and&nbsp;here. A.Downloading the Ethereum Mist Wallet To store, accept and send ether, you need a wallet. Download&nbsp;the latest release of mist wallet. Scroll down to Downloads and choose the release as per the system you’re using. Downloading theEthereum Mist&nbsp;Wallet Choose Ethereum-Wallet-YourSystem. For this guide, I’m working through the installation of the wallet for Mac OS i.e. I select Ethereum-Wallet-macosx-0–8–1.zip Once you click on the link, it’ll automatically start to download the zip file. After you unzip the folder, look for Ethereum-Wallet application and launch it. B. Installing the Wallet After you launch, you’ll see this: Installing The&nbsp;Wallet Once the node is fully synced, you’ll be asked to choose the network. For testing purpose, choose ‘USE THE TEST NETWORK’ option. Choose the TEST Network Once Node is&nbsp;synced Choose your password: Choose Your Password. And REMEMBER YOUR&nbsp;PASSWORD Protect your account with a strong password. Put in the strong password and remember it. Seriously! You cannot EVER change the password of this account once it’s created. So,&nbsp;remember the password. C. Your Account Ethereum Mist Wallet Accounts&nbsp;Overview This is what the Wallet’s overview screen looks like. At the top of your Wallet overview screen, you’ll see the info related to the sync status of your node. If the node has stopped syncing (e.g. zero peers or block number not changing), try restarting the Wallet app or wait for some time. Under Accounts, you can see the number of accounts and Ether balance in every account. Your Account Address Go inside the ‘MAIN ACCOUNT’. The string below your account name is your account address. It starts with 0x. Ethereum Mist Wallet — Your Account&nbsp;Address Note: Ethereum Account addresses are in hexadecimal format. They are made up of 40 characters (hexadecimal digits).
