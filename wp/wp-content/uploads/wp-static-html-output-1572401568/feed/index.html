								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Great Wall Motor (GWM) reported a splendid hike in the third-quarter (Q3) profit compared with the same period a year ago, after the Chinese biggest SUV and pickup manufacturer announced a double-digit growth in Q3 sales volume.</p>



<p>GWM said its net profit attributable to the parent company&#8217;s shareholders for the third quarter amounted to around RMB1.4 billion, skyrocketing 507% year on year. During the reporting period, it gained gross revenue of RMB21.202 billion, a year on year growth of 18.01%.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, for the first three quarters, the automaker saw its gross revenue reach RMB62.578 billion (-6.1%) and net profit total around RMB2.917 billion (-25.7%).</p>



<p>With 724,113 vehicles sold in total, the company obtained a year-on-year growth of 7.01%, a bright spot amid the prolonged downturn for China&#8217;s auto market.<br></p>

<p>The mainstay SUV brand, Haval, saw this year&#8217;s cumulative sales jump 11.58% over a year ago to 521,252 units.

The F-series, since its launch last year, imbues the automaker with new growth energy.<br></p>

<p>WEY, which was designed to help GWM move upscale, has sold 13,125 vehicles for the first three quarters. On October 22, the premium SUV brand saw the milestone 300,000th vehicle come off the production line at GWM&#8217;s Xushui plant. Besides, the roll-out of new models such as the 2020 WEY VV6, the 2020 VV7, the VV7 GT and the 2020 VV5 consolidated its foothold in corresponding segments.<br></p>

<p>Moreover, GWM is pushing ahead with its deployment in electrification, one of technical trends sweeping China&#8217;s auto industry. The young NEV brand ORA sold 32,186 cars through September, gaining great consumers&#8217; acceptance thanks to its youth-targeted marketing programs and product definition.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Shanghai (Gasgoo)-</strong>&nbsp;Chinese largest automaker SAIC Motor is said to launch its first 5G-powered model, which is also the unprecedented one to the world, in April, 2020, according to a local media outlet, citing Zu Sijie, vice president and chief engineer of SAIC Motor.</p>



<p>“The concept of ‘building Internet cars’ is about to connect vehicles with Internet in a bid to make automobile a part of Internet or IoT (Internet of Things). In a strategic partnership with Huawei and China Mobile, we are working on developing the global first 5G-enabled vehicle, which is expected to be launched in next year&#8217;s April,” said Zu Sijie.</p>



<p>As an important technology that promotes ICVs down the road, 5G can substantially speed up data transmission with high stability and low latency. It plays a vital role in R&amp;D of autonomous vehicles. Theoretically, 5G is able to reach a transmission speed of up to 1GB per eight seconds, over 10 times faster than that of 4G technology.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-based auto giant has been undertaking the collaboration focusing on 5G-based ICVs with China Mobile and Huawei for more than two years. As early as June, 2017, the three companies jointly showcased the world’s first-time 5G-based remote driving application, marking an important milestone in improving the reliability of autonomous and driverless vehicles, and also a major step forward in commercial application, said Huawei.<br></p>

<p>One year after, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) Shanghai 2018, three parties co-demonstrated the application of ICVs using the low-latency network enabled by 5G Era LTE and the cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology. The demonstration involved a human operator who remotely and precisely controlled the out-field fleet via the driving control console located at the exhibition hall.</p>



<p>In April 2019, the project of China&#8217;s first demonstration zone for 5G-based smart transportation was formally initiated under joint efforts of SAIC Motor, China Mobile, Huawei and Shanghai International Automobile City. The construction is expected to be completed next year and afterwards be open to the public.</p>
