Allows you to merge terms, set term parents in bulk, and swap term taxonomies.

== Description ==

If you need to reorganize your tags and categories, this plugin will make it easier for you. It adds two new options to the Bulk Actions dropdown on term management pages:

* Merge - combine two or more terms into one
* Set parent - set the parent for one or more terms (for hierarchical taxonomies)
* Change taxonomy - convert terms from one taxonomy to another

It works with tags, categories and [custom taxonomies](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies).

= Usage =

1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Posts -> Categories`.
2. Find the Bulk Actions dropdown.
3. Reorganize away.

= No support =

I, scribu, will not be offering support for this plugin anymore (either free or paid).

Fixes are submitted by other contributors, on [Github](https://github.com/scribu/wp-term-management-tools).

== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip the "term-management-tools" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

== Screenshots ==

1. Merge
2. Set parent
